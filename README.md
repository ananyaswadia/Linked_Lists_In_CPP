## Theory
In C++, a linked list is a linear data structure that allows the users to store data in non-contiguous memory locations. A linked list is defined as a collection of nodes where each node consists of two members which represents its value and a next/previous pointer which stores the address for the next/previous node.
### Key Components of a Linked List
Node:The fundamental building block of a linked list.

Each node typically consists of:

--Data: The actual value or information stored in the node.

--Next Pointer: A pointer that stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence. In a singly linked list, this is the only pointer. In a doubly linked list, there's also a "previous" pointer.

--Head:A pointer that points to the first node of the linked list. If the list is empty, the head pointer is typically nullptr. 
### Types of Linked Lists
Based on the structure of linked lists, they can be classified into several types

-Singly Linked List

-Doubly Linked List

-Circular Linked List
