## Theory
In C++, a linked list is a linear data structure that allows the users to store data in non-contiguous memory locations. A linked list is defined as a collection of nodes where each node consists of two members which represents its value and a next/previous pointer which stores the address for the next/previous node.

Types of Linked Lists

Based on the structure of linked lists, they can be classified into several types:
-Singly Linked List
-Doubly Linked List
-Circular Linked List
